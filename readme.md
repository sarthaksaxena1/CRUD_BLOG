# blog-app (10/2017)
 
## Description:
A simple blog app where anybody can write down anything helpful so everyone can view. Fully implemented and user experience improved by security authentication and authorization.<br />
Built in [cloud9](https://c9.io) - a powerful online code editor with a full Ubuntu workspace in the cloud.

### Setup MongoDB
* If built with [cloud 9](https://community.c9.io/t/setting-up-mongodb/1717) 
* If built locally and run with real mongoDB, you need to have (https://mlab.com) account and name your database blog (for example) as well as dbuser and dbpassword: 
```
mongoose.connect("mongodb://dbuser:dbpassword@ds000000.mlab.com:00000/blog", {useMongoClient: true});
```
### NPM Install
```
npm install  
node app.js
```
- express (Server-side Javascript)
- ejs (Embedded Javascript)
- express-sanitizer (middleware after initilize `body-parser` for node-validation) 
- body-parser 
- mongoose (mongoDB for Express version)
- method-override (used for method PUT and DELETE in RESTful ROUTE that form type in cliend-side doesn't support
- connect-flash (middleware: store message displayed for user once and cleared after page being refreshed)
- passport
- passport-local
- passport-local-mongoose
- express-session

## Simple guideline from scratch
 1. The differences between Authentication and Authorization:
 - Authentication: get people signup/login. In other words, people need to tell app/website who they are.
 - Authorization: Once figure out who user is, grant permission on specific things they are allowed to do.
 2. How To Do?
 - Hint: 
   + Verify the id of current user with id of author who creates the post
   + However, id of current user - a string (req.user._id) is different than id of author (foundBlog.author.id) - a mongoose object
   + Instead of using: if(req.user._id === foundBlog.author.id). We use:
   ```
   if(foundBlog.author.id.equals(req.user._id)){
                  ...
          }
   ```
